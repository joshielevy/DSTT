#' Build an R Markdown file that is in a subdirectory
#' 
#' Function to move all files in a subdirectory to the user's home directory, build the markdown file there,
#' and return the built version to the original subdirectory.  Why would you want to do this?  Because
#' R Markdown doesn't build nicely on RStudio Server on a mapped network drive due to a bug in Pandoc, so
#' sometimes you need to move everything to somewhere else.
#' 
#' @param subdir sub directory (relative to the project directory) holding a report and its necessary files
#' @param report_name name of the report, excluding the .Rmd suffix.
#' @param ... other arguments to be passed to rmarkdown::render()
